# MCP Inspector Integration

The Clay extension includes a seamless integration with the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), a visual testing tool for MCP servers. This integration serves the MCP Inspector directly from the Clay gateway server for maximum simplicity and performance.

## Features

- Connect to the Clay MCP server with a single click
- Test MCP tools, resources, and prompts
- Debug MCP server responses
- Visualize MCP server capabilities
- Zero configuration required
- Served directly from Clay gateway server

## Usage

1. **Start the Clay servers** using the extension (both gateway and MCP servers)
2. **Open the MCP Inspector** by:
   - Running the command `Clay: Open MCP Inspector` from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)
   - Using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M

The MCP Inspector will automatically load from the gateway server and connect to your Clay MCP server.

## Simplified Architecture

The new streamlined integration works by:
1. **Clay Gateway Server**: Serves the MCP Inspector UI at `/mcp-inspector`
2. **MCP Proxy Endpoints**: Gateway server forwards MCP requests to Clay MCP server
3. **VS Code Webview**: Simply loads the inspector from the gateway server
4. **Connection Flow**: Inspector UI ‚Üí Gateway Server ‚Üí Clay MCP Server

## Installation

No additional installation or build steps required! The MCP Inspector is automatically available when you:
```bash
npm install  # Installs @modelcontextprotocol/inspector dependency
```

The inspector UI is served directly from the gateway server using the npm package files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the MCP Inspector:

1. **Gateway Server Not Running**: Ensure the Clay gateway server is started (it serves the inspector)
2. **MCP Server Not Running**: Make sure the Clay MCP server is also running
3. **Connection Issues**: Check that both servers are running on their configured ports
4. **Package Issues**: Ensure `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` is installed with `npm install`
5. **Browser Issues**: Try refreshing the webview or restarting VS Code

## Benefits of the Simplified Integration

- **üöÄ Zero Build Steps**: No compilation or bundling required
- **‚ö° Instant Loading**: Inspector loads directly from gateway server
- **üîß Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with Clay servers
- **üì¶ Minimal Extension Size**: No bundled UI files in extension
- **üîÑ Automatic Updates**: Inspector updates with `npm update`
- **üõ°Ô∏è Better Reliability**: Uses standard web server architecture
- **üéØ Simpler Debugging**: Can test inspector in regular browser at `http://localhost:3000/mcp-inspector`
